            Satoru Gojo (Japanese: 五条 悟, Hepburn: Gojō Satoru) is a fictional character from Gege Akutami's manga Jujutsu Kaisen. He was first introduced in Akutami's short series Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School as the mentor of the cursed teenager Yuta Okkotsu at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. This miniseries became the prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0 of Jujutsu Kaisen. In Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo takes the same role but mentors the student Yuji Itadori who suffers a similar Curse, helping him become stronger while protecting other characters in the series.

                He was capable of entirely overpowering and killing Jogo, who was the strongest of the group, and simply his presence was able to force Hanami to retreat, with Gojo almost killing the special-grade cursed spirit with a single attack. When Kenjaku and his group finally developed a plan to face him in combat, despite their preparations, Satoru was still capable of easily fending off their assaults and overpowering them, leaving them astounded with how exceeding his capabilities truly were, killing Hanami and only being defeated due to Kenjaku using his past with Geto to distract him long enough for the Prison Realm to seal him.
